# Extended_Depth_of_Field

Depth of Field refers to the range of distance over which a subject appears in-focus in a photographic image. The objective is to extend the depth of field without sacrificing resolution or brightness, making it possible to clearly capture a subject without adjusting interval and angle between subject and camera. Scenes that used to require multiple cameras or readjusting focus can now be captured at once with a single camera.

This code receives different images of the same set of objects, focused at different unknown distances and generates a composite image where the different objects appear in focus simultaneously.
